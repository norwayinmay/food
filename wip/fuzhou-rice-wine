Recipe from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgXFTNbW2Vs

1kg glutinous rice
100g redfermented rice/dried yeast
40g dry yeast ball
1.6 litres hot water


Cook the glutinous rice in the water the night before and completely cool.
Sterilise a large jar and air-dry.

Blitz the red rice in a mixer and break down the yeast ball.
Spread the glutinous rice onto a tray and sprinkle the mixture on top.
Wearing clean gloves, mix well together and add to the jar, pressing down with a sterilised ladle.

Mostly-close the jar leaving an air-gap, and let it rest for 7-10 days: after 2 days press down again and mix with a sterilised ladle, and again at the 7-day mark.
Seal the jar and leave it for 40 days.
Optionally, strain the mixture to leave the wine, or cook with it as-is.
