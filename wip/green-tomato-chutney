Halve the cherry tomatoes and chop the red onion if fresh. Mix well in a bowl with 1-2tsp salt and leave for 3 hours.

Mix the sugar, spices, and vinegar in a pan and heat gently, stirring occasionally until all the sugar is dissolved.
Chop 50g apple into small (~1cm) chunks (can leave the skin on) and add to the pan along with the sultanas. Cook for 10 min then add the tomato mixture.

Bring to the boil and simmer for at hour with the lid on. Mash in the pot with the back of the spoon and simmer on the lowest heat for another hour, stirring/mashing occasionally.

Once the chutney has thickened up, spoon into the jars and seal.
