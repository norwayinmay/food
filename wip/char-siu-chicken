160g-200g diced chicken breast
2-3 heaped tsp of lee kum kee char siu sauce
1-2 dark tsp soy sauce
optional -- handful of cashew nuts
olive oil for frying

Mix the char siu, and soy sauce into the chicken pieces and ideally leave to marinade for a few hours.

Dry-fry the cashews if using them until they start to brown.
Add the oil and the chicken along with all its sauce.
Fry on medium-high heat for 6-9 minutes, add a splash of hot water if needed to keep the suace from drying out.

Good served with green veg like broccoli or beans.
