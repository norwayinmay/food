1 onion or bunch of spring onions
1 garlic cube
3 tsp smoked paprika
1 tin tomatoes
1/2 chicken stock cube + splash of hot water
1 tsp mixed herbs
1 courgette
2 carrots
ground black pepper
salt
~300g potatoes in large chunks

presumably there was some chicken?

to test:
- how much chicken
- weight of carrots
