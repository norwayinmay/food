2-3 cloves garlic
150g lean pork mince
150-200g frozen broccoli pieces

olive oil
1/2 salt
1/3 tsp 5-spice powder
3-4 tsp soy sauce


Roughly chop the garlic and fry for a few seconds.
Add the mince, and sprinkle the salt, 5-spice, and soy straight on top.
Break up the mince and mix in well; fry until browned.
While it's cooking, microwave the broccoli at 1000W for 3 minutes and drain the water.
Leave covered in the bowl for the heat to spread evenly until the mince is cooked.
Add to the frying pan for a further 3 minutes or till everything is cooked through.
