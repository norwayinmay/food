100g sugar
125ml lemon juice
zest of 2 small/medium lemons
60ml + 250ml cold water

makes about a pint (bit less)

- put the sugar, 60ml cold water, and lemon zest into a pan
- heat until the sugar dissolves, don't need to heat any further
- mix in the remaining water; aerate and freeze (e.g. in ice cream maker, or by stirring with a spoon/fork/hand blender every hour in the freezer)
**need to confirm non-icecream maker process, haven't tried this way yet.
